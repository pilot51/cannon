Whether you like Cannon or not, please rate it and leave a constructive comment.

As with everything I create for the public, I am open to suggestions, bug reports, questions, comments, etc. I am very easy to contact, more communication mediums are listed on my website. A list of known issues is available on the Cannon website.

It is very important if you report a bug that you contact me in a way that I can reply in case I need more information. A Market comment won't work.

Many thanks to the testers and helpers!
