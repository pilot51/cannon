Immediately before release:
	Test on all API's and screen sizes, particularly 1.6 QVGA and 1.5 HVGA
	In all projects, set release date in strings and version in strings and manifest
	Clean before compiling
	Install old version from Market to make sure update from Market works properly
	Save sources along with binary for each release version

Problems:
	HIGH - Targets spawning completely inside other targets in random mode, impossible to hit with collision enabled
	HIGH - Fit borders and keep random targets within scaled screen, also scale targets relative to screen scale
	MED - Bottom of scrollview in custom screen doesn't lose fade when at bottom  
	MED - Handle orientation/keyboard changes

v2.0.0:
	Update About dialog
	Usability - Tell players what the controls are [suggested by HotShots]
	Score combos when hitting targets with consecutive projectiles
	Display and saving of scores

Pro (first release):
	Look into the new copy protection
	Live wallpaper - Random mode with random shots 

v2.0.1:
	Zoom & pan
	Prevent random targets from spawning too close to launcher
	Adjust minimum size of targets

v2.0.2:
	Stop GameField activity when leaving it
	Option: Analytics
	Add some suggestions

v2.1.0
	Sounds
	Textures, maybe themes
	Explosive projectile with shrapnel
	Moving targets [extstw]
	Missions: preset, random, or infinitely calculated targets that need to be hit to reach higher levels
	Basic multiplayer

v2.2.0:
	Multiplayer: Hotseat & direct IP
		Simultaneous turn-based, allowing projectiles to collide
		One player places target, other player tries hitting it (requires in-game angle/velocity controls)
		Players try to hit randomly placed target [suggested by SuM_WuN]
			After so many seconds, closest shot wins
			First direct hit wins
	Gravity presets (earth, moon, mars, etc.)
	Different types of targets/projectiles with different collision physics
		Projectiles: Bouncy, sticky, explosive

Suggested features (high priority):
	Preview before firing [Tyler]
	Pause, timestep forward/back, speed [+1 by extstw]
	Explosions [+1 by extstw]
	For missions: Multiple projectiles/targets, hit multiple targets with a single projectile (maybe in an order) [+1 by extstw]
	Fading tail [extstw]
	Moving targets [extstw]
	Obstacles [extstw]
	Cluster bomb [extstw]
	Return to main screen after shot [Bill Irwin] Self note: Make optional, maybe enabled by default

Bin:
	More realistic wind (limited speed, not squared)
	Air resistance/density (ballistic coefficient on Wikipedia)
	Solve feature (automatically enter most conservative values in null fields necessary to hit the target)
	Dynamic gravity (targets that push or pull)
	Option: Show overlay data for projectile X, Y, speed, angle of motion, and time
